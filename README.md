Accessible IPRC Seizure Notice
==============================

The copyright infringement domain seizure notices, like those that SOPA threatens, violate mandatory government accessibility requirements defined in section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. 794d). The original official notices are provided as an image file and nothing more (such as <http://74.81.170.110/IPRC_Seized_2010_11.jpg>, although there seem to be a few variants). 

Last June (2011) I went ahead and recreated the notice using accessible web standards with XHTML and gracefully degrading CSS3. I naively emailed the IPRC (responsbile for the notice) with this complaint & solution, but recieved no response. Come on guys.
